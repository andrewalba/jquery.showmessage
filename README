jQuery notification method similar to one found on Twitter site.

== Description ==

This jQuery plug-in was inspired by a similar effect you can see on the Twitter site. Some of the advantages: 

*   Notification toolbar displayed at the top or bottom of page (no scrolling to view error)
*	Multiple messages can be displayed in notification bar
*	Options to automatically close the notification bar after set delay
*	Notification bar closes with blur/'esc' key/'close' link

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1.  Download jquery.showmessage and unzip/unpack on in your public directory
1.  Insert `<link type="text/css" href="/path/to/assets/css/showMessage.css" rel="stylesheet" screen="media"/> in the head of your document.
1.	Insert `<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/assets/js/jquery.showMessage.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>` after jQuery is loaded (end of page).
1.	Call the plugin (default appends to <body/>. `$.showMessage({'thisMessage':['This is message one!','This is second message']});`

== Changelog ==

= v3.1 =
* Serious rewrite to fix the following errors.
* Incorrect merge of plugin defaults
* Validation errors
* Javascript errors

= v3.0 =
* Complete rewrite to better harness jQuery methods and create API for ease of use.
* Replaced position option to reflect CSS style position attribute.
* Former position attribute name changed to location. Options remain ['top','bottom'].

= v2.4 =
* Found warning for unscoped variable 'event'. Changed line 60 to read keycode = window.event.keyCode;
* Added some different styles to the notification windows.

= v2.3 =
* Plug-in was overwriting the selected element with 'body' element (was accidently hard coded and never properly removed).
* Added another option for z-index. Ran into an issue where notification was being placed behind a light box. The new option will give more flexibility to and allow the plug-in to determine various z-index.

= v2.2 =
* Minor change as per recommendation by Sebastian Kun (http://www.arcestra.com/).
* Added options for better 'internationalization' of navigation text. Sebastian added two more options for closeLink text and closeText text.
* Removed the jquery.showMessage.pack.js option

= v2.1 =
* Minor change to option.position. Changed order so looking for top position else set to bottom.
* Issue with IE7+ if there is no doctype declared (shame on you, since DOCTYPES are vital to the proper functioning of web standards in browsers), we have changed insertion of #showMessage to either .prepend() or .append() depending on if position is top or bottom.

= v2.0 =
* Received a request to make some improvements to the plugin from DaveG. Thank you much for the constructive comments DaveG.
* Added new option useEsc to allow the 'esc' key to be optional (boolean true|false).
* Changed the global variable t to be included in the function and renamed to showMessage_t.
* Extended the plugin to use the jQuery.fn (does not return a value so this may not be chainable).
