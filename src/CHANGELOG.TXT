2.4    :::::::::::....... 2011-04-18 .......::::::::::::::
// ********************************************************
	Found warning for unscoped variable 'event'. Changed 
	line 60 to read keycode = window.event.keyCode;
	
	Added some different styles to the notification
	windows.
	
2.3    :::::::::::....... 2010-12-20 .......::::::::::::::
// ********************************************************
	Plug-in was overwriting the selected element with
	'body' element (was accidently hard coded and never
	properly removed).
	
	Added another option for z-index. Ran into an issue
	where notification was being placed behind a light box.
	The new option will give more flexibility to and allow
	the plug-in to determine various z-index.

2.2    :::::::::::....... 2010-11-23 .......::::::::::::::
// ********************************************************
	Minor change as per recommendation by Sebastian Kun
	(http://www.arcestra.com/).
	
	Added options for better 'internationalization' of 
	navigation text. Sebastian added two more options for
	closeLink text and closeText text.
	
	Removed the jquery.showMessage.pack.js option

2.1    :::::::::::....... 2010-05-06 .......::::::::::::::
// ********************************************************
	Minor change to option.position. Changed order so
	looking for top position else set to bottom.
	
	Issue with IE7+ if there is no doctype declared (shame
	on you, since DOCTYPES are vital to the proper
	functioning of web standards in browsers), we have
	changed insertion of #showMessage to either .prepend()
	or .append() depending on if position is top or 
	bottom.
	
2.0    :::::::::::....... 2010-04-05 .......::::::::::::::
// ********************************************************
	Received a request to make some improvements to the 
	plugin from DaveG. Thank you much for the constructive
	comments DaveG.
	
	Added new option useEsc to allow the 'esc' key to be
	optional (boolean true|false).
	
	Changed the global variable t to be included in the
	function and renamed to showMessage_t.
	
	Extended the plugin to use the jQuery.fn (does not
	return a value so this may not be chainable).
